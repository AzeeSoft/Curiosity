  title: Crashed Satellite
  description: 'The scorch marks and impact residue indicates that this relic crashed
    with an extreme velocity from a high alititude. It emits the same radioactive
    signature as many of these abandoned structures. Perhaps what caused this satellite
    to crash is what caused this settlement to be abandoned. '
