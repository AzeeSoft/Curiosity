  title: Tire
  description: 'A stray tire found on the Martian Surface, just an abandoned tire?
    Or a clue to the whereabouts of the people who crashed this vehicle? The wreck
    looks fresh, perhaps they are still nearby... It has been a long time since the
    Curiosity rover left Earth. Perhaps if Curiosity could find these travelers, they
    could take her home! '
